### What's New

Spellsource - Server Version: 6.1.2 - Client Version: 2.0.9

Known Issues:

 - Some situations with drawing cards from the deck can cause the game to hang.

Content Fixes:

 - Reckless Flurry now works. Previously, it did not deduct armor.
 - Giant Barbecue now deals damage to the target of the spell.
 - Crackling Arrows now works when the player has no secrets.
 - Little Helper now interacts with Vashj's Plot correctly.
 - Lady Vashj now puts a Serpent Spine Bow into play.
 - Elaborate Scheme no longer triggers Gloat if Scheme puts Gloat onto the battlefield with Scheme's effect.
 - Ravenous Lasher now triggers.
 - Sorrowstone now triggers when more than three minions die at a time.
 - Conjured Assistance only triggers if it can actually pull anything from your hand.

Usability Fixes:

 - Milling and discarding cards now appear in the Power History.
 - Any triggers whose side effects cause a card to be revealed will appear in the power history. For example, Dragonling Pet ("Start of Game: If your deck has no tribal minions except Dragons, draw this card from your deck.") will now appear in the power history at the start of the game.
 - UI elements overlap less.
 - The number of power history elements has been reduced to 8 from 10.
 - Power history from a previous match is no longer present.
 - The Edit button in the Quick Play / Matchmaking views is now a pencil icon button.
 - The enemy hero and minions will correctly get highlighted when you begin a physical attack. Previously, the highlighting only appeared once you hovered over a valid target.
 - The enemy hero can be targeted by battlecries on your second and later matches.
