Choose ones now work on mobile devices.

### 0.8.4-2.0.15 (Saturday, December 22nd, 2018)

A longstanding issue where mulligans appear to bug out the game has been solved. You are also less likely to run into older cards.

###### Usability Fixes:

 - Mulligans no longer retain information from previous matches. This prevents an unrecoverable error during the mulligan phase on the server.
 - The game finds leftover cards and removes them from play after you finish or concede your current game.
