 - The bot will perform better overall. It should find lethal by using a combination of direct damage spells, physical attacks and weapons. It may miss lethal in situations that depend on removing an opponent's taunt minions, healing on physical attack or damage triggers (like minions with both taunt and lifesteal) that give the opponent's hero health, direct damage battlecries or other advanced effects.
