Thanks to great contributions from @Beatdoof and @Jdude, new Dragoon and Summoner cards have been added!

Also a big shout out to @bdg for a very kind Christmas gift. Spellsource will always be free, and everyone's contributions -- playing, inviting players, testing, QA, writing cards, coding, card design and other debate -- is amazingly helpful.

 - Lord Jaraxxus now correctly removes himself from the battlefield after being played.
 - Corrupted Blood now shuffles copies of itself into your deck after the sequence ends. This prevents you from taking infinite damage when the last card in your deck is a Corrupted Blood, and an effect causes you to draw a card at the end of your turn.
 - Flesheating Ghoul and other death trigger minions no longer trigger from the removal of permanents.
 - Shudderwock now correctly stops casting battlecries if it is removed from the board by dealing damage to itself until death.
