###### 0.8.4-2.0.16 (Saturday, December 22nd)

Choose ones now work on mobile devices.

###### 0.8.4-2.0.15 (Saturday, December 22nd)

A longstanding issue where mulligans appear to bug out the game has been solved. You are also less likely to run into older cards.

###### Usability Fixes:

 - Mulligans no longer retain information from previous matches. This prevents an unrecoverable error during the mulligan phase on the server.
 - The game finds leftover cards and removes them from play after you finish or concede your current game.

Thanks to great contributions from @Beatdoof and @TheFlawlessWalrus, new Dragoon and Summoner cards have been added! @doombubbles has also authored some fixes and updates to balance changes in H.S. cards.

Also a big shout out to @bdg for a very kind Christmas gift. Spellsource will always be free, and everyone's contributions -- playing, inviting players, testing, QA, writing cards, coding, card design and other debate -- is amazingly helpful.

And finally, a shout out to @doombubbles for quietly fixing bugs and adding features in the past, like our dynamic card text system.
