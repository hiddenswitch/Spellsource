### 0.8.22-2.0.29 (Thursday, April 11th, 2019)

Thanks to a contribution from @Logovaz, there are new cards for Senzaku!

The following keywords have been consistently applied to Spellsource cards:

 - Champion: Your player character. When this dies, you lose the game.
 - Skill: A spell your Champion can play every turn.
 - Opener: Occurs whenever the card is played from the hand.
 - Aftermath: Occurs whenever a minion dies (horribly) on the battlefield.
 - Hidden: This minion cannot be targeted by enemies until it deals damage.
 - Dodge: The first time this minion takes damage, it takes zero instead.
 - Dash: This can attack enemy minions even if it is exhausted.
 - Blitz: This can attack enemies even if it is exhausted.
 - Spellpower (X): Your Spells deal this much more damage.
 - Toxic: This kills minions it damages.
 - Guard: This must be destroyed before minions can attack its champion.
 
Now clarifying the following additional keywords:

 - Armor: Instead of losing health, lose this instead.
 - Deflect: The first time this minion takes damage, deal it to its Champion instead.
 - Wither (X): This reduces its target's health by this amount, and restores the health at the start of the caster's turn.
 - Enchantment: Occurs as long as the target this is attached to is in play.
 - Exhausted: During the turn it comes into play or changes sides, this minion is exhausted and cannot attack this turn. It loses exhaustion at the start of next turn.
 - Elusive: Cannot be targeted by spells or skills.
 - Drain (X): Deals this much damage to the target, then heals the source by this amount. Any excess is given as extra health instead.
 - Roast: Remove a card from the top of your deck.
 - Reservoir (X): Occurs when your deck is larger than this amount.
 - Sacrifice: Occurs whenever a friendly minion dies.
 - Silence: The text on this card and any enchantments added later are no longer in play.
 - Supremacy: Occurs whenever this minion attacks and kills another.
 - Surge: Occurs when a card is played from the hand on the same turn it was added to the hand.
