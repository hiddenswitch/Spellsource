        the Dragovian civil war, the mystery behind the Emperor's coma,
        the gods, and the giant dragons.
    -   Shun He surrenders to Princess Briila on simple terms: humans

        way, the Vision was fake and the Oni are coming. He offers to
        fight in an alliance with her against the Oni.
    -   She refuses, says she defeated the Oni in Gramlot, declares
        victory and orders Shun He to be thrown into the Firegate's
        magical lava pit, believing he will be turned to rock, a mere

        out of the Firegate.

        discovering that the magic invulnerability is completely
        disabled. With all the nobles in one place and the throne
        suddenly up for grabs, the Dragovians begin fighting each other
        in the midst of the sleeping, unharmed emperor. Princess Briila
        flies back to Atumjun.
    -   Paucha tells Agfen that the Firegate is open and souls can now
        enter the Oni underworld to replenish it. With the help of the

        exit from the Oni underworld—and free the rest of the Oni and
        Bogovey on Moromah.

        settlers hastily set sail on their half-built and only boat.
