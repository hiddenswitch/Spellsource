The Lung Archipelago is surrounded by a magical, physically impenetrable
barrier known as the Lunopause.

It extends about 80 kilometers from the shores in a circle around the
island. From outside the circle looking in towards the islands, it
appears to be a powerful storm at sea, with whipping rains, dark black
clouds, lightning and powerful tornados and vortices. It is invisible
looking out from the islands.

[Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"), aboard his magical junk the
[Lungcao](/wiki/Lungcao "wikilink"), was the first human to break through it
from the outside.
