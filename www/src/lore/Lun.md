**Lun** (also known as The Spellstone, Gurin-no-Magatama, or Lunstone)
is a rare mineral that can be found on [The
Mainland](/wiki/The_Mainland "wikilink"). It is the only known substance that
provides magical properties, including
[Animation](/wiki/Animation "wikilink"),
[Transformation](/wiki/Transformation "wikilink"), and [Law
Variaton](/wiki/Law_Variaton "wikilink"). Upon
[Awakening](/wiki/Awakening "wikilink"), it produces
[Spellmist](/wiki/Spellmist "wikilink"), that allows other magical
utilizations. In the [Lotus Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), people
that can Awaken stones are called [Alchemists](/wiki/Alchemists "wikilink"),
who are governed by the [Grand Alchemist](/wiki/Grand_Alchemist "wikilink").

In nature, Lun has grey color, and it has similar properties to
obsidian, but when Awakened, it radiates Spellmist, a green mist that
quickly disperses unless utilized. The quantity that evaporates from the
stone is negligible in short time frame, but when constantly used it
exponentially loses its volume.

Lun isn't a substance that's fully understand yet by anyone, and
the different peoples of the world have different theories on what Lun *really* is.

Humans that take notice of magic generally think the same thing that [Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink") thought for most of his life&mdash;that Lun comes from the air.
However, Shun's experiences on Moromah island are leading him to change his views.

The ruling clan of the  enforce the view
that Lun is the promethean gift of their emperor, the giant dragon slumbering inside
Mount Moromah.

The dominant view among [Dragovians](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink") is that Lun is the
promethean gift of their emperor, the giant dragon slumbering inside Mount Moromah.
Specifically, it is the tears he sheds for his people that contain the magical
substance. The haughty Vahlok clan collects these "tears" in the streams coming off the
mountain and uses it to dominate the other clans. As keepers of the Emperor's tears,
they follow strict traditions when it comes to magic and prevent any further
investigation.

The Bogovey clan was exiled from the rest of the Dragovians for questioning this orthodoxy. They believe they know the true nature of Lun. It comes from underground, and deep below the demongate on Krah, you can find the highestâ€¦ and most dangerous concentrations of Lun.

The animals and spirits of the world don't think very much about Lun, besides
just seeing it as a substance that's pretty much everywhere.
