**Lun** (also known as The Spellstone, Gurin-no-Magatama, or Lunstone)
is a rare mineral that can be found on [The
Mainland](/wiki/The_Mainland "wikilink"). It is the only known substance that
provides magical properties, including
[Animation](/wiki/Animation "wikilink"),
[Transformation](/wiki/Transformation "wikilink"), and [Law
Variaton](/wiki/Law_Variaton "wikilink"). Upon
[Awakening](/wiki/Awakening "wikilink"), it produces
[Spellmist](/wiki/Spellmist "wikilink"), that allows other magical
utilizations. In the [Lotus Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), people
that can Awaken stones are called [Alchemists](/wiki/Alchemists "wikilink"),
who are governed by the [Grand Alchemist](/wiki/Grand_Alchemist "wikilink").

In nature, Lun has grey color, and it has similar properties to
obsidian, but when Awakened, it radiates Spellmist, a green mist that
quickly disperses unless utilized. The quantity that evaporates from the
stone is negligible in short time frame, but when constantly used it
exponentially loses its volume.

Historians argue that the Lun is the residue of Spellsource, or the
Spellmist that condensated during larger emissions of Spellsources'
energy, while the others claim that Lun is actually the separate entity
that creates Spellmist, other than Spellsource. Current Grand Alchemist,
[Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"), does not confirm either of the theorems,
as he is not certain himself.
