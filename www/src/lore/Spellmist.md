**Spellmist** is the gaseous, highly energized inert substance that can
be utilized into what most people call magic.

Origins
-------

In nature, Spellmist is scarce and interacts weakly with chemical or
physical forces. It diffuses in the air and flows along magnetic lines,
behaving like a corollary to electricity.

In the [Mainland](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), humans concentrate it by
[awakening](/wiki/Awakening "wikilink") [Lunstones](Lun "wikilink"). In
magical realms, like the [Lung Archipelago](/wiki/Moromah_Island "wikilink"),
Spellmist is abundant in the atmosphere and dissolved in liquids.

The [Dragovians](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink") believe it is a remanent of
long-deceased gods. The [Bogovey](/wiki/Bogovey "wikilink"), a Dragovian clan,
believe it originates with the [Oni](/wiki/Oni "wikilink"), who originate from
a demon realm accessed via a [Demongate](/wiki/Demongate "wikilink").

Properties
----------

It is ordinarily unobservable. The Spellmist can be only seen by humans
upon Awakening, when it is manifested as green mist, and it quickly
"evaporates," or loses its color and its potential for usage.

In the Lung Archipelago, the Spellmist still cannot be seen by humans.
Magical beings like [Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink") can see and even sense the
usage of it.

There are many devices created by the Lotus Empire that can compensate
humans lack of sense for Spellmist, but they are prone to
malfunctioning, as they get overcharged in the area of Archipelago. One
such device was the [Sextant](/wiki/Sextant "wikilink") used to navigate the
[Lungcao](/wiki/Lungcao "wikilink") to the archipelago.

Its physical manifestation is light, sound and force. In its free,
uncontrolled form, Spellmist will typically take the sensory
manifestations of natural things, known as [Nature
Mimicry](/wiki/Nature_Mimicry "wikilink"). At the interface between the
archipelago and the Human realm, it manifests as perpetually threatening
weather in the [Lunopause](/wiki/Lunopause "wikilink").

Uses
----

The Spellmist behaves like a high-energy force that is "aware" of its
user's intent.

### Among Humans

After significant study and literal meditation among Lunstones,
Awakeners can perform sophisticated spells and conjurings.

Spellmist can be controlled to reproduce natural phenomenon. This
exploits its Nature Mimicry. Novices typically make only illusory
phenomena. An advanced Awakener can make phenomena that both looks and
acts real. For example, a novice's rain, when drunk, would only feel
like it quenches thirst; an advanced Awakener's rain would actually
quench thirst.

Advanced Awakeners can create physical, moving matter called
[Constructs](/wiki/Constructs "wikilink"). These are moving, conjured beings,
sometimes autonomous and sometimes under the control of the Awakener.
Their mobility is achieved via [Animation](/wiki/Animation "wikilink"). This
magical act was used to activate constructs towards social ends, like
delivering messages, doing physical labor, or in automated processes.

At the time of [Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink")'s departure, Spellmist is
mostly utilized in warfare. The [Lotus Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink")
pioneered offensive Spellmist it during its conquest of its many
neighbors.

The key military innovation was [Imperial
Flame](/wiki/Dragonbreath "wikilink"), known as dragonbreath to the magical
beings of the Archipelago, a fire that cannot be extinguished by any
non-magical means. The warrior-monks of the Empire exhausted nearly all
the Spellmist extracted via awakening to create perpetual-flame
barricades and to lay indefinite siege upon hapless, common enemies.

### Among Magical Beings

There are creatures that require Spellmist for their basic life
functions, and they almost exclusively inhabit Lung Archipelago.

[Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink"), whose ancestors were early humans arriving at the
archipelago, developed their symbiotic relationship with spellmist over
many generations. It gives them the ability to [Share
Vision](/wiki/Share_Vision "wikilink"), to breath underwater without the
radical development of gills, and to communicate with plants and
animals.

The scholars of the human world do not yet fully understand the role of
spellmist for [Dragovians](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink") and
[Oni](/wiki/Oni "wikilink").

The [Hengeyokai](/wiki/Hengeyokai "wikilink") are believed to have existed in
animal form on the archipelago before magic came to the island. The
spellmist played a role in their development to sentient shapeshifters,
along with the arrival of the Fae's human progenitors.
