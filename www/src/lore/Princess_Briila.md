### Biography

Her name means "beautiful magic", and since her birth Briila was raised
to be a priestess of [Mount Moromah](/wiki/Mount_Moromah "wikilink").
[Lir](/wiki/Lir "wikilink"), her father and the Daimyo of the
[Vohlok](/wiki/Vohlok "wikilink"), had many children, and Briila was content
to give up any royal ambition for a life of study. But fate had other
plans for her. Harnessing the magic of the mount, Lir declared himself
Shogun and waged war on any clan that refused fealty. The ensuing
battles took their toll; many of Briila's brothers and sisters died in
combat. In the end, it was [Agfen](/wiki/Agfen "wikilink"), Briila's brother,
who won the decisive battle against the fierce
[Fassnu](/wiki/Fassnu "wikilink") and ended the war.

However, terrible rumors persisted about Agfen's victory and the
mysterious magic he used to secure it. Visiting the battlefield, Briila
discovered that her brother had used dark magic to recruit demons to
fight by his side. She told her father and as punishment, he stripped
Agfen of his titles and of his wings. In revenge, Agfen cursed his
father with madness. Before completely losing his wits, Lir announced
Briila would be his new heir. A political neophyte, Briila must now
defend the Vahlok from enemies all around her: her rebellious brother
and the other clans. [Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink")'s human expedition is
her first test. If she fails to destroy it, the other clans will surely
know her weakness and destroy her family.
