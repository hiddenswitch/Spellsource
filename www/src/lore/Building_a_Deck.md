Before any game of Spellsource, you first have to construct a deck! If
building a deck seems daunting or too time consuming for your tastes,
that's no problem! We have plenty of pre-built decks for you to choose
from! For the bolder of you, let's dive more into the construction of a
deck.

### Picking a Champion

There are a number of different champions to choose from in the game!
Each of them has their own unique theme and playstyle, and there are
still more being added in! Each champion will have a distinct color and
skill associated with it. Pick the one that interests you most and then
we can move on to the next step!

### Choosing your Cards

In a standard match of Spellsource, each deck consists of 30 cards
total. A card can have any one of five rarities: Free, Common, Rare,
Epic, or Legendary. Each deck can contain only 1 copy of each Legendary
card, but can contain up to 2 copies of any other card.

### Quick Tips

-   It is generally advised to have 2 copies of a card in your deck if
    possible, since this will make your deck far more consistent.
-   Try to have a reasonable balance of Lun costs in your deck. You want
    to be sure you have cards to play early in the game as well as
    strong cards that can dominate a game later on!
-   Try to build your deck around a theme or specific strategy. Do you
    have a Legendary card that your really really like? Let that be the
    start of you deck!
