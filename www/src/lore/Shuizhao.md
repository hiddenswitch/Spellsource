Shuizhao are a giant crustacean inhabiting the island near
[Pearl](/wiki/Pearl "wikilink").

Their eggs are prized for their magical properties. In magical warfare,
the eggs can be manipulated to hatch powerful minions instead of
ordinary Shuizhao. They can also be used as a [Jail](/wiki/Jail "wikilink"),
removing a creature from a physical realm until the egg hatches or is
destroyed.
