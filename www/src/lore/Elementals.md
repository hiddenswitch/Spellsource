Elementals are created by massive concentrations of Lun. Sometimes that concentration gets in the air through an small eruption of Mount Moromah which creates Air Elementals. Sometime an earthquake exposes a vein of Lun in the earth which creates Earth Elementals. [Lun](/wiki/Lun "wikilink") is an animating energy, so focusing it can animate anything. Normally, these elementals are extremely short lived. Like think of natural disasters with the angry personality of animals. But the different factions -- [Human](/wiki/Humans "wikilink"), [Dragonovian](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink"), [Demon](/wiki/Oni "wikilink"), [Hengeyokai](/wiki/Hengeyokai "wikilink"), and [Spirit Folk](/wiki/Fae "wikilink") -- have their own ways of controlling those elementals to use in battle.

These constructed elementals are not as powerful as the naturally occurring ones, but they are much longer lasting. While a natural Air Elemental feels like a tornado crossed with a vulture, the Vahlok Wind Construct uses that same power to create a scout, like an Eagle made of pure air. So Constructs could be thought of as Elementals whose power has been controlled by alchemy and technology.
