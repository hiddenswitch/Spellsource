Passed Vision describes a power among specially trained
[Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink") to share a recent visual image or memory.

All creatures with a "third eye" have some form of Passed Vision. Fae
can therefore communicate with some animals via this power. This also
limits domestication of third-eye animals of prey, because they pass
down past visions of being eaten by the civilized tribes of the island.

In the presence of chemical fire, as opposed to
[dragonbreath](dragonbreath "wikilink"), Fae can pass vision to humans.
