The Vision of Landfall describes a dream by [the
Emperor](the_Emperor "wikilink") that [Princess
Briila](/wiki/Princess_Briila "wikilink") interrupted while trying to diagnose
the mysterious cause of his sleep.

In this dream, scaleless Dragovians mill amongst the feet of a Giant on
a sandy beach. The giant bends down and rips out trees, placing them far
away in the water, where they transform into boats filled with more
scaleless Dragovians that sail back to the shore. Briila appears to be
walking amongst the Dragovians, and sees them putting out
[dragonbreath](dragonbreath "wikilink") using water, which ordinarily
cannot put out the magical flame.

She follows one to a boat, where he begins unpacking crates of mute
Hengeyokai â€” cows, cats and pigs. They look at her puzzled. The giant
takes a handful of animals and eats them, making eye contact with
Briila. She is the next to be scooped, devoured into his mouth and wakes
up.

The face of the giant is [Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink")'s.

Briila interpreted the dream as an omen of destruction and declares war
on the humans because of it.
