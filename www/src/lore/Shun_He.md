Shun He is the Grand Alchemist of the [Lotus
Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), a blind monk and leader of the
[Human](/wiki/Humans "wikilink") settlers.

### Biography

Shun was born in the desert kingdom of [Yunnon](/wiki/Yunnon "wikilink"), the
son of an advisor/alchemist to its great Khan. When the Lotus Empire invaded 
Yunnon, he was captured and refused to swear fealty. His bravery
impressed the Lotus Emperor so he let Shun He live in servitude, but
blinded him as punishment. For the next 20 years, Shun devoted himself
to the study of [Lun](/wiki/Lun_Substance "wikilink"), the faint magical substance that
pervades the world.

He remembered one summer when glowing blue flecks -- like a thousand fireflies -- 
floated through the air. His grandmother captured these flecks in jars to sell 
at her market stand as trinkets, and young Shun He stole one for himself. As an 
experiment, he dropped his sister's doll inside and sealed it up. That's when 
something incredible happened. 

The doll started to move on its own.

Shun was able to recreate these results, and the emperor was so impressed that 
he named him the new Grand Alchemist and orders him to use any resource he needs 
to harness Lun and fashion it into weapons of war.

Blindness forced Shun to adopt a rigorous scientific method,
experiencing the world purely through science and mathematics. It also
protected him from the sneers of the nobility at court — his outsider
status and foreign appearance made Shun the frequent victim of the royal
jester. Nevertheless, he was relentless in his research. With the industrial 
base of the Lotus Empire at his disposal, Shun He built the Lunvane -- 
a device that can detect the presence of Lun in the air -- and with it he made
discoveries: Lun's appearance is random except it appears more on windy days. 
Then there's the most important discovery of all. 

Lun is coming from the East, across the ocean.

Armed with this knowledge, Shun He convinces the emperor to mount an expedition 
and find the source of Lun. He so impressed the Lotus Emperor that he 
commissioned Shun as his blind explorer. Now, any courtier that dared laugh 
would be immediately sentenced to death.

### Arrival in the Lung Archipelago

With the support of the emperor, Shun began construction of the
[Lungcao](/wiki/Lungcao "wikilink"), a grand junk holding a few hundred men
and enough resources to survive a short while on what he believed to be
a fertile island chain.

The journey began at sea with observations of the
[Lunopause](/wiki/Lunopause "wikilink"), a powerful storm Shun understood to
be shielding the islands. These observations were mediated by a weakly
magical sextant Shun used to navigate by touch. Shun realized that the
supposed magical shielding built into the Lungcao was unnecessary. The
key to visiting the islands was using the sextant to navigate through an
illusory part of the storm. However, he never revealed his insight to
his crew.

Despite his efforts, the Lungcao sustained serious damage by the other
side of the Lunopause. Shun directed the crew to make landfall at the
first sight of sand. Passing a stony, treacherous island, they arrived
at an alluvial beach.

There, Shun made [first contact](/wiki/First_Contact "wikilink") with
[Inora](/wiki/Inora_Ithkal "wikilink"), a three-eyed [Fae](Fae "wikilink")
healer and sea priestess. All the while, his Lunvane was going haywire. It was 
no longer pointing in any one direction and instead spinning wildly.

Perhaps the Lun doesn't come from the air after all…
