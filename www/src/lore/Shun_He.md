Shun He is the Grand Alchemist of the [Lotus
Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), a blind monk and leader of the
[Human](/wiki/Humans "wikilink") settlers.

### Biography

Shun was born in the desert kingdom of [Yunnon](/wiki/Yunnon "wikilink"), the
son of an advisor to its great Khan. When the Lotus Empire invaded
Yunnon, he was captured and refused to swear fealty. His bravery
impressed the Lotus Emperor so he let Shun He live in servitude, but
blinded him as punishment. For the next 20 years, Shun devoted himself
to the study of [Lun](/wiki/Lun "wikilink"), the faint magical substance that
pervades the world.

Blindness forced Shun to adopt a rigorous scientific method,
experiencing the world purely through science and mathematics. It also
protected him from the sneers of the nobility at court â€” his outsider
status and foreign appearance made Shun the frequent victim of the royal
jester. When his research led him to discover the fabled source of all
magic, he so impressed the Lotus Emperor that he commissioned Shun as
his blind explorer. And any courtier that dared laugh would be
immediately sentenced to death.

### Arrival in the Lung Archipelago

With the support of the emperor, Shun began construction of the
[Lungcao](/wiki/Lungcao "wikilink"), a grand junk holding a few hundred men
and enough resources to survive a short while on what he believed to be
a fertile island chain.

The journey began at sea with observations of the
[Lunopause](/wiki/Lunopause "wikilink"), a powerful storm Shun understood to
be shielding the islands. These observations were mediated by a weakly
magical sextant Shun used to navigate by touch. Shun realized that the
supposed magical shielding built into the Lungcao was unnecessary. The
key to visiting the islands was using the sextant to navigate through an
illusory part of the storm. However, he never revealed his insight to
his crew.

Despite his efforts, the Lungcao sustained serious damage by the other
side of the Lunopause. Shun directed the crew to make landfall at the
first sight of sand. Passing a stony, treacherous island, they arrived
at an alluvial beach.

There, Shun made [first contact](/wiki/First_Contact "wikilink") with
[Inora](/wiki/Inora_Ithkal "wikilink"), a three-eyed [Fae](Fae "wikilink")
healer and sea priestess.
