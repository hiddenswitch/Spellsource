Dragonbreath is a magical form of fire used by the inhabitants of the
Lung Archipelago for heat, light, warfare and spells. It is known to
humans as [Imperial Flame](/wiki/Dragonbreath "wikilink").

Properties
----------

Unlike chemical fire, dragonbreath does not consume fuel nor extinguish
due to the lack of oxygen. It is "aware" when it is used for warfare or
cooking, capable of burning flesh, wood and many kinds of stone.
Otherwise, it does not burn substances it touches, and when used for
gentle heat or lighting, it can be manipulated by hand.

Origins
-------

All the dragonbreath in the Lung Archipelago originated from the belly
of the last living god, [The Giant Sleeping
Emperor](/wiki/The_Emperor "wikilink"); or, it is ancient dragonbreath from
the legendary gods, like [Ketzal](/wiki/Ketzal "wikilink") and
[Akylo](/wiki/Akylo "wikilink").

Dragonbreath in the human realm originates in a magical conversion
ritual. Because it is so difficult to put out, the formula for its
creation is closely protected by [Alchemists](/wiki/Alchemists "wikilink"),
the keepers of the practice of [Awakening](/wiki/Awakening "wikilink").

Uses
----

Different kinds of dragonbreath have different characteristics.

On the mainland, dragonbreath created from
[Lunstones](/wiki/Lunstone "wikilink") appears to have only destructive and
offensive capabilities. It always emerges as a burning force, and it is
as difficult to control as natural fire.

Imbuing written text with dragonbreath turns it into a whispering rune.
The whispering can be heard by animals that ordinarily cannot hear.
Imbuing text written by the ancient gods this way taught Dragovian
scholars how the ancients sounded.

A Vohlok initiation rite into the warrior class starts with the young
warrior's first drink of dragonbreath.

Exceptionally ancient dragonbreath has been found in ruins deep
underground, constructed by mysterious progenitors of the present
Dragovians.
