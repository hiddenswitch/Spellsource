First contact describes the actual meeting (as opposed to
[vision](/wiki/Vision_of_Landfall "wikilink")) between the human [Shun
He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink") and the [Fae](Fae "wikilink") healer [Inora
Ithkal](/wiki/Inora_Ithkal "wikilink").

The waterscout [Susong](/wiki/Susong "wikilink") was the first to see the
tattered sails of the grand junk [Lungcao](/wiki/Lungcao "wikilink"), which
wrecked on a sandy beach near the eventual location of [Pearl
Colony](/wiki/Pearl_Colony "wikilink") but far from any permanent Fae
structure. Unable to interpret what she was seeing, she ran to her
chief, the healer [Inora Ithkal](/wiki/Inora_Ithkal "wikilink"), who was
ranging with the scouts. Using [Passed
Vision](/wiki/Passed_Vision "wikilink"), Inora recognized the boat immediately
from a personal dream of hers. Inora told the waterscout to go home, and
Inora arrived on the beach herself to make first contact.

Approximately 180 sailors aboard the Lungcao pitched tents while Inora
tried to communicate with the blind [Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"),
captain of the the Lungcao and the leader of [Pearl
Colony](/wiki/Pearl_Colony "wikilink"). The seahand
[Jojokai](/wiki/Jojokai "wikilink") lit a routine, small fire. Inora felt a
powerful, unfamiliar force from this fire, realizing it was the first on
the island that did not originate from
[dragonbreath](dragonbreath "wikilink").

Leading Shun He to the fire, hand in hand, she could pass vision to him
as long as they touched and felt the heat. In this vision, Shun He
learned of a source of water, technology to build with steelgrass, the
written and spoken languages of the archipelago
([Sylvan](/wiki/Wyspan "wikilink")), and the identity of the Fae's leader,
[Shiramba](/wiki/Shiramba "wikilink").
