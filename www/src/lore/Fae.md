![Land Fae](Spirit_Folk_of_the_Forest_(Land).jpg "fig:Land Fae") ![Sea
Fae](Spirit_Folk_of_the_Sea.png "fig:Sea Fae") They are the first
inhabitants of the [Lung Islands](/wiki/Moromah_Island "wikilink"), the
descendants of [humans](humans "wikilink") who came to the Islands
thousand of years ago and spirits of Nature. Slender and short with
delicate features, they are beautiful magical beings. Their human
ancestry and great beauty makes them an attractive race for Humans. They
live in families or clans, and answer to a Lord: the [Lord of the
Forest](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Forest "wikilink") and the [Lord of the
Rivers](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rivers "wikilink"). These Lords are pure magical
beings. They also cohabit with the [Hengeyokai](/wiki/Hengeyokai "wikilink")
and speak the same language, [Sylvan](/wiki/Sylvan "wikilink"), or language of
the Forest. They have special powers related to natural forces or
events: for instance, they can communicate with animals and each other
using [Passed Vision](/wiki/Passed_Vision "wikilink"), or use the [five
elements](/wiki/Five_Elements "wikilink") to cast spells.
