Pearl Colony is the first and largest [Human](/wiki/Humans "wikilink")
settlement in the [Lung Archipelago](/wiki/Moromah_Island "wikilink").

History
-------

The delta of the [Lungrath River](/wiki/Lungrath_River "wikilink") was
inhabited by [Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink") of the Sea. Their homes were built in
the water itself, using the driftwood deposited from the river, the
shells of the giant crustacean [Shuizhao](/wiki/Shuizhao "wikilink") and reeds
from [Moromahn steelgrass](/wiki/Moromahn_steelgrass "wikilink"). Prior to the
arrival of humans, the swampy territory was harvested for important
medicines and Shuizhao eggs.

The colony was established shortly after [First
Contact](/wiki/First_Contact "wikilink").
