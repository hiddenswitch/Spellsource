**Awakening** is the process of initiating
[Spellmist](/wiki/Spellmist "wikilink") sublimation from
[Lun](/wiki/Lun_Substance "wikilink"), where the Awakener uses chemical reactions and
other Lunstone that is already in the process of Awakening to initiate
the process. The Awakening is a tedious procedure that required years of
training and practice, but its exact steps have evolved over time.

History
-------

It had been discovered accidentally and mischaracterized by scholars
throughout human history. The contemporary process was created by the
current [Grand Alchemist](/wiki/Grand_Alchemist "wikilink"), [Shun
He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"), who invented a precise method of initiation
with the least possible number of resources and concentration from the
Awakener.

This procedure created a new professional class in the Lotus Empire.
They are called [Alchemists](/wiki/Alchemists "wikilink"), and they are the
only people privileged to Awaken and train others to do so. Their number
is not high compared to other Imperial officials, as the Alchemy is
relatively new professional discipline.

The current Grand Alchemist, [Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"), is the most
well known Alchemist, as he raised himself quickly with his many
scientific achievements, of which was most famous [Hypothesis of
Spellsource](/wiki/Hypothesis_of_Spellsource "wikilink").

Up until discovery of [Lung Archipelago](/wiki/Lung_Archipelago "wikilink"),
it was thought that Awakening is a stable process, which meant that the
chance of malfunctioning was close to nonexistent. But upon [First
Contact](/wiki/First_Contact "wikilink"), the arriving humans realized
Awakening in oversaturated Spellmist areas (like the archipelago)
creates volatile instabilities.

Once the mathematicians in the [Pearl Colony](/wiki/Pearl_Colony "wikilink")
realized that Spellmist could be extracted geometrically instead of
linearly from the archipelago's ambient environment, Pearl reoriented
common human practices around an abundance of spellmist. Humans began to
thrive, and Alchemists entrenched themselves as the most powerful class
among people on the islands.

Consequently, the original procedure of Awakening is now used in the Old
World only. In Pearl, the concentration of Spellmist has made Lunstones
obsoleteâ€”and even dangerous.
