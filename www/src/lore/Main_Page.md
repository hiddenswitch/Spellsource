![The Lung
Archipelago](Map.png "fig:The Lung Archipelago")

Greetings, [settler](/wiki/Humans "wikilink")! The world's greatest explorer,
[Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"), leads an expedition to find the fabled
source of all magic. After many months at sea, his ships pierce a
[magical barrier](magical_barrier "wikilink") and crash on a mysterious
[Volcanic island](/wiki/Moromah_Island "wikilink"). With his ships destroyed,
he steps up a colony aided by local [Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink"), strange
humanoid creatures imbued with magic. This must be the spell-source
they've been seeking. But unbeknownst to the colonists, the
[Dragons](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink") are watching and preparing to drive
them off the island.

The war between people and Dragovians will force all the other island
races—[Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink"), the plucky
[Hengeyokai](/wiki/Hengeyokai "wikilink"), and the dark
[Oni](/wiki/Oni "wikilink")—to pick up arms. Which side will you choose?

### Setting

Spellsource takes place on the islands of the [Lung
Archipelago](/wiki/Moromah_Island "wikilink") in a medieval fantasy setting.
Outside the archipelago lies the [The Mainland](/wiki/The_Mainland "wikilink")
(also known as the Old World or just the [Lotus
Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), its principle civilization).

Important locations include [Pearl Colony](/wiki/Pearl_Colony "wikilink"), the
principle settlement of the humans, and [Moromah
Island](/wiki/Moromah_Island "wikilink"), the largest island of the
archipelago. [Mount Moromah](/wiki/Mount_Moromah "wikilink") is the geographic
location of the largest city on the island,
[Atumjun](/wiki/Atumjun "wikilink"). Its most unusual gateway is the
[Demongate](/wiki/Demongate "wikilink"). Another large city is [Gramlot](/wiki/Gramlot "wikilink").

### Conflict

A power struggle began among the [Dragovians](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink"),
the dominant race on the islands. Their
[Emperor](/wiki/The_Emperor "wikilink") has fallen into a deep sleep of
magical origins, and the various tribes of the Dragovians suspect each
other of betraying the throne. Meanwhile, [humans](humans "wikilink")
have made [First Contact](/wiki/First_Contact "wikilink") with their arrival
to the islands, as foretold by the [Vision of
Landfall](/wiki/Vision_of_Landfall "wikilink").

### Heroes

    Empire.

    they are led by an eccentric and ruthless explorer to the Lung
    islands in hope of finding the source of all magic.
