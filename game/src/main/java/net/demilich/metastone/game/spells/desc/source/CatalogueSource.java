 * Returns a list of collectible cards from the  {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.decks.DeckFormat} for this game

 * <p>
 * This source has {@link HasCardCreationSideEffects}, which indicates that it doesn't refer to cards inside the game
 * but rather generates new copies on the fly.

 * This source also has the aforementioned weights indicated by {@link HasWeights}.

 * This is the default card source for {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.DiscoverSpell}.
 *
 * @see UnweightedCatalogueSource for a card source that returns all cards in the deck format from all classes as
 * 		frequently as neutrals.
