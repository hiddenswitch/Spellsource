/**
 * The location of an entity inside a {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.GameContext}.
 * <p>
 * Every entity has an {@link EntityLocation} that starts as {@link #UNASSIGNED}. The creator of the {@link Entity} object
 * should add it to an {@link EntityZone}, which sets that entity's {@link Entity#entityLocation}.
 * <p>
 * A location has a {@link Player}, {@link Zones} and {@link Integer} {@link #index} tuple that are comparable and
 * exclusiveâ€”only one entity can be in a given location at a given time. These locations are used to find entities like
 * {@link GameContext#tryFind(EntityReference)}, to support effects like {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.AdjacentEffectSpell},
 * and to support networking effects and diffing for game state.
 * @see Entity#getEntityLocation() to look up an entity's current location.
 * @see Entity#getEntityLocation()#getIndex() to get the entity's index in an entity zone.
 * @see EntityZone for the {@link java.util.List} that sets this property on an {@link Entity} whenever it is the
 * argument to an {@link EntityZone#add(Object)} or {@link EntityZone#move(Entity, EntityZone)}.
 * @see EntityZone#move(Entity, EntityZone) for the method to use to move an entity from one entity to another when
 * you already know which zone the entity is in.
 * @see Entity#moveOrAddTo(GameContext, Zones) for the method that moves an entity from its current zone to the newly
 * specified zone.
 * @see EntityZone#indexOf(Object) to get the index of the an entity in O(1) time (it just uses its {@link Entity#getEntityLocation()#getIndex()}}
 * method to find the index quickly).
 * @see Player#getZone(Zones) for the method that gets the {@link EntityZone} from a player object.
 * @see GameContext#getEntities() for a method that iterates through all the entities in all the zones in a {@link GameContext}
 * @see GameState#getEntities() for a method that iterates through all the entities in all the zones for a {@link GameState}
 * (a {@link GameState} stores all the data/model that is needed to reconstruct a {@link GameContext}.
