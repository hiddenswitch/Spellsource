/**
 * This enum describes the keys to the {@link SpellDesc} / the keys of the dictionaries in the {@link
 * net.demilich.metastone.game.cards.desc.CardDesc} card JSON files for spells.}
 * <p>
 * To see how a particular argument is interpreted, refer to the Java {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.Spell}
 * class written in the {@link SpellArg#CLASS} field of the {@link SpellDesc}. For example, if you see the spell:
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     "class": "DrawCardSpell",
 *     "value": 1
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Observe that {@link SpellArg#VALUE} corresponds to the key {@code "value"} in this JSON. All the fields in the JSON
 * in {@code camelCase} have a corresponding field name in {@code UPPER_CASE}. To see what {@code "value"} / {@link
 * SpellArg#VALUE} means in this context, visit {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.DrawCardSpell}.
 * <p>
 * Observe that every {@code SpellArg} enum value is a key in the JSON for spell effects, except {@code camelCased} and
 * surrounded by quotation marks. When you read documentation for {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.Spell}
 * subclasses and you see a {@code SpellArg} referred to there, assume the documentation is telling you to write a
 * {@code camelCased} version of the {@code SpellArg} into the JSON to get the effect you want. For example, if the
 * documentation says that {@link #EXCLUSIVE}, when set to {@code true}, does something, you'll write something like
 * this in the JSON:
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     ...
 *     "exclusive": true
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Whenever a new entry is added here, a corresponding deserialization instruction must be authoered in {@link
 * DescDeserializer#init(DescDeserializer.SerializationContext)}. If a new type is added (the right hand side of the
 * JSON key/value pair), a new {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.cards.desc.ParseValueType} needs to be added.
 *
 * @see DescDeserializer#init(DescDeserializer.SerializationContext) for the formal type of the values of these enum
 * 		keys.
