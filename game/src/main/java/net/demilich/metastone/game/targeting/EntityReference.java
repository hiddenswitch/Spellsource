/**
 * An entity reference identifies a specific game entity, like a card or minion; or, it is interpreted as a group of
 * entities, possibly always of length 1 (like {@link #FRIENDLY_HERO}) or 0 or more ({@link #FRIENDLY_MINIONS}). These
 * references are called group references, and their {@link #isTargetGroup()} will return {@code true}.
 * <p>
 * Group references are appropriate to put into {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.desc.SpellArg#TARGET}. If
 * {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.desc.SpellArg#RANDOM_TARGET} is specified along with a group reference, a
 * random entity from the group will be chosen.
 * <p>
 * When {@link Entity#getReference()} is called, a specific (non-group) reference is always returned. Thus, calling
 * {@link Hero#getReference()} will never return {@link #FRIENDLY_HERO}.
 * <p>
 * When the target has been transformed, group reference resolution will always return the transformed targets using
 * {@link Entity#transformResolved(GameContext)}. Resolving a target using {@link GameContext#resolveSingleTarget(EntityReference)}
 * will also always return the transformed target, regardless if it is a group reference or not.
 * <p>
 * All references omit {@link Attribute#PERMANENT} actors except {@link #SELF}, {@link #ALL_ENTITIES}, {@link
 * #TRIGGER_HOST}, {@link #OUTPUT}, {@link #EVENT_SOURCE}, {@link #EVENT_TARGET} and {@link #TRANSFORM_REFERENCE}.
 * <p>
 * Friendly versus enemy references are evaluated with respect to the calling/casting player. This includes triggers
 * that are put on the opponent by effects cast by the player. In other words, regardless of "where" the {@code source}
 * is, the {@code player} from whose point of view the reference is being resolved is always the caster.
 * <p>
 * This can be confusing in a situation like Loatheb, who puts a {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.cards.costmodifier.CardCostModifier}
 * on the caster's {@link Player} entity whose {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.desc.manamodifier.CardCostModifierArg#TARGET}
 * is {@link #FRIENDLY_HAND} but whose {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.desc.manamodifier.CardCostModifierArg#TARGET_PLAYER}
 * is {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.TargetPlayer#OPPONENT}. In card cost modifiers, target player is used to
 * determine if a modifier affects a card by comparing the trigger's owner to the card's owner; opponent indicates that
 * the card's owner must not equal the trigger's owner. However, {@link #FRIENDLY_HAND} is evaluated from each player's
 * point of view separately, because card cost modifiers ({@link net.demilich.metastone.game.logic.GameLogic#getModifiedManaCost(Player,
 * Card)}) are evaluated by both players, always (this allows opponents to see card cost changes).
 * <p>
 * Or, for example, Temporus causes a spell to be cast during the turn of the opponent of the owner of Temporus. The
 * {@code source} of the spell that modifies the {@link Attribute#EXTRA_TURN} of both players is cast during the
 * opponent's turn and in an event whose {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.TargetPlayer} is the opponent. But,
 * {@link net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.desc.trigger.EnchantmentDesc#spell} is always cast by the enchantment's
 * owner, which was the caster who originally put the enchantment into play. Therefore, the {@code source} will be the
 * same as the player who put Temporus onto the battlefield, and that's from whose point of view the {@link
 * #FRIENDLY_PLAYER} and {@link #ENEMY_PLAYER} will be evaluated.
 *
 * @see net.demilich.metastone.game.GameContext#resolveTarget(Player, Entity, EntityReference) to see how references are
 * 		interpreted.
 * @see net.demilich.metastone.game.spells.Spell#cast(GameContext, Player, SpellDesc, Entity, List) to see more about
 * 		how group references are used in the casting of spells.
