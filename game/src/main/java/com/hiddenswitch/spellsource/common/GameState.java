/**
 * The fields that correspond to a complete state of the game.

 * This game state is used, in practice, as a snapshot of the game in a specific point in time using {@link
 * GameContext#getGameStateCopy()} and to copy games using {@link GameContext#setGameState(GameState)}.
 * <p>
 * Creating a game state using {@link GameContext#getGameState()} produces an instance whose objects are shared with the
 * {@code GameContext}. Mutating the player objects, for example, in such a game state will also mutate the player
 * objects in the context. To retrieve a copy, use {@link GameContext#getGameState()} or {@link #clone()} the state.
 * <p>
 * While the fields in this instance are immutable, the engine does not prevent changes to fields within the fields.
 * This is <b>not</b> an immutable data type.
