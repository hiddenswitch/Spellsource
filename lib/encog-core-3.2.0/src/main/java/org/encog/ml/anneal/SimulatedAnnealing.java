/**
 * Simulated annealing is a common training method. This class implements a
 * simulated annealing algorithm that can be used both for neural networks, as
 * well as more general cases. This class is abstract, so a more specialized
 * simulated annealing subclass will need to be created for each intended use.
 * This book demonstrates how to use the simulated annealing algorithm to train
 * feedforward neural networks, as well as find a solution to the traveling
 * salesman problem.
 * 
 * The name and inspiration come from annealing in metallurgy, a technique
 * involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size
 * of its crystals and reduce their defects. The heat causes the atoms to become
 * unstuck from their initial positions (a local minimum of the internal energy)
 * and wander randomly through states of higher energy; the slow cooling gives
 * them more chances of finding configurations with lower internal energy than
 * the initial one.
 * 
 * @param <UNIT_TYPE>
 *            What type of data makes up the solution.
