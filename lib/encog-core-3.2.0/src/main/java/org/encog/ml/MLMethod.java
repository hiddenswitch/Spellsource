/**
 * This interface is the base for all Encog Machine Learning methods.  It 
 * defines very little, other than the fact that a subclass is a Machine 
 * Learning Method.  A MLMethod is an algorithm that accepts data and 
 * provides some sort of insight into it.  This could be a neural network, 
 * support vector machine, clustering algorithm, or something else entirely.
 * 
 * Many MLMethods must be trained by a MLTrain object before they are useful.
