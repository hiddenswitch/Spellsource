# Contributing

Skyhook happily accepts pull requests for new providers and features. To make the process quick and easy, follow this brief guide.

### Code Style

We have tslint configured for the project. If you are using VSCode (which you should, because it is awesome) and have the tslint plugin installed, you will be guided through the coding style and changes will be suggested. While writing your changes, please follow the code style maintained throughout the project. You should browse some of the existing code to get a feel of the style.

### Working on Changes

All of your changes should be made on a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the main project.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you may submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). This will give the project maintainers a chance to review the code you have submitted and, if necessary, request changes. Once the maintainers are happy with your changes, your pull request will be merged.

> Note that to add more commits to your pull request, you only need to push commits to the branch of your fork from which you based the pull request.

### Local Testing

In order to test the features you've implemented, it's a good idea to setup and run skyhook locally.

Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed and have cloned the repo. Open a command window in the root folder and run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies. From there you can start the server by simply running the command `npm start`.

In order to accept data from the webhook providers, you should forward the port which skyhook will bind to. By default, this is set to `8080`, however if another port is more convienient for you, you may change this in the code. **Be mindful not to submit this change in a pull request.**

> If you are unable to forward a port you may use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

Once the port is forwarded, you should be able to start the server and have it open for requests. You can validate this by going to `{your-public-ip}:8080`. If the skyhook webpage loads, then the port is forwarded correctly.

From here you should be able to [setup](https://github.com/Commit451/skyhook#setup) webooks through your local copy of skyhook. **Note that when setting up your webhooks you MUST replace `skyhook.glitch.me` with `{your-public-ip}:8080`.**

If your changes work, the provider's webhooks should be parsed and forwarded to discord. You can also write tests in the `test` directory, using the other tests as an example, to make sure your webhook parsing is working.
