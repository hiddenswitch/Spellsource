Until 1.0, the `GameContext` will call `requestAction` on a behaviour whenever playing a card results in a discover or battlecry action to take, resulting in possibly recursive calls to `requestAction` whenever simulating; at 1.0, there will never be recursive calls to `requestAction`.\n",

    " 2. In the process of simulating all the possible actions, the agent simulates playing a Discover card.\n",
    " 3. Inside the simulated `GameContext`, the discover card calls `requestAction` on the original behaviour instance. `requestAction` is pushed to the call stack a second time.\n",
    " 4. The behaviour must deal with the recursive call appropriately (the current AIs do).\n",
    " 5. The simulated `requestAction` is popped off the call stack.\n",
