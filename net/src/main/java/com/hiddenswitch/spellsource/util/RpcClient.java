	 * <pre>
	 *     {@code
	 *     // Notice that unusually, the handler comes before the actual method call, and accepts any type as its

	 * <p>

	 * co.paralleluniverse.fibers.Fiber}. Otherwise, you're strongly encouraged to use {@link #sync()}, which is
	 * idiomatically cleaner.
	 * <p>
	 * Internally, this retrieves a proxy of the service configured for async calls. Pass the handler for the result
	 * first. The methods called on the proxy will <b>not</b> return their values, they will return null. The call will
	 * go across the {@link io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus} and arrive to your handler.
	 *
	 * @param handler The handler of the async call. Fully specify the handler to get the right type for the method you
	 *                subsequently call on the proxy.
	 * @param <R>     The return type of the method you will call on the proxy. This is typically a Response object.
