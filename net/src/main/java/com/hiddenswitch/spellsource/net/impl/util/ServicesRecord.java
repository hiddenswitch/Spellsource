/**
 * An ServicesRecord contains the sensitive information the server needs to authenticate clients.
 * <p>
 * In this protocol, user passwords are hashed with sha256. The hash is stored on the server. Later, when the user logs
 * in with an email and password, the password is used with the Scrypt hash comparison function. If the password matches
 * the hash, a LoginToken is issued to the client.
 * <p>
 * The {@link LoginToken} contains a public (user ID) and private (randomly generated string) portion. The server stores
 * an Scrypt hash of the private portion of the LoginToken. When the user authenticates using a token, the accounts
 * security system finds the appropriate user record with the public (user ID) field of the token. Then it compares the
 * secret to the stored hash of the secret. If it matches, the client is authorized.
 * <p>
 * No secrets are ever leaked by this object. The stored data cannot be used by the public API to authenticate the user,
 * since the original secrets pre-hash (either user password or randomly generated token) were never stored.
