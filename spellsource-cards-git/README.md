# cards

This module contains game play definitions for cards.

It also contains test code. For example, [this class](src/test/java/com/hiddenswitch/spellsource/tests/cards/CardValidationTests.java) is responsible for testing whether or not the card JSON is valid.

### What belongs in this module

 - **Functional game content**: This module must contain only functional game content. This means a definition of the behaviour of cards, like what happens when they enter play, their mana costs, triggers, attack and defense values, and other things that represent the minimum the game engine needs to know to correctly execute the rules of the card.

 - **Clean room implementations**: Whenever the title and description are included, they were written as a "clean room" implementation: the author had only seen the functional code alone when writing the description and title on the card.

 - **Custom Hearthstone**: The functional aspect of content from [Custom Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/) is okay, while the title and description text of the card is not.

### What does not belong in this module

 - **Unlicensed for Github:** Anything, regardless of how or if it is copyrighted, that is not licensed for redistribution in a public Git repository.

 - **Copyrighted material from other games**. This includes the titles and descriptions written on cards.
 
 - **Derivative work**: An automated or deterministic rewriting (derivation) of copyrighted content. For example, mass-substituting the Hearthstone card text by replacing and rewriting sentences in a mechanistic way is not acceptable for this module.
 
 - **Trademarks**: The use of **any** trademarked term, alive or dead, that appears in other media. For example: Even though the particular card title "Planeswalker Alchemist" doesn't appear in Magic the Gathering, Wizards of the Coast has a dead trademark for Planeswalkers.

 - **Confusing material**: Anything that may lead a reasonable person to believe that a piece of content originates from a commercial media property. This includes parodies, homages and other references. For example: Even though "Cartman Renounces Darkness" is a reasonable parody of two commercial media properties, it may lead a reasonable person to believe that Blizzard and South Park Studios worked together on a card set.
