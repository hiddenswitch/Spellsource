Elementals are created by massive concentrations of Lun. Sometimes that concentration gets in the air through an small
eruption of Mount Moromah which creates Air Elementals. Sometime an earthquake exposes a vein of Lun in the earth which
creates Earth Elementals. [Lun](/wiki/Lun "wikilink") is an animating energy, so focusing it can animate anything.
Normally, these elementals are extremely short lived. Like think of natural disasters with the angry personality of
animals. But the different
factions -- [Human](/wiki/Humans "wikilink"), [Dragonovian](/wiki/Dragovians "wikilink"), [Demon](/wiki/Oni "wikilink"), [Hengeyokai](/wiki/Hengeyokai "wikilink"),
and [Spirit Folk](/wiki/Fae "wikilink") -- have their own ways of controlling those elementals to use in battle.

These constructed elementals are not as powerful as the naturally occurring ones, but they are much longer lasting.
While a natural Air Elemental feels like a tornado crossed with a vulture, the Vahlok Wind Construct uses that same
power to create a scout, like an Eagle made of pure air. So Constructs could be thought of as Elementals whose power has
been controlled by alchemy and technology.
