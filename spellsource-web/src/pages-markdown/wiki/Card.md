There
are a many types of cards that you can utilize in your quest to achieve
victory!

- **Minion Cards** have attack printed on the bottom left corner and
  health on the bottom right corner.
- **Weapon Cards** have their attack printed on the bottom left corner
  and their durability printed on the bottom right.
- **Spell Cards** have no general numerical attributes aside from
  their mana costs. Their effects are printed on the body of the card.
- **Permanent Cards** also have no other general numerical attribute.
  Their effects are again, printed on the body of the card.

All of these cards feature text on the body of the text, which details
abilities that the card has. These can vary from one time effects, to
consistent auras, to effects that occur when a specific action occurs
(like drawing a card or destroying a minion). These are often some of
the most important aspects of a card and can lead to victory when
utilized to their fullest!

Categorizing Cards
------------------

Spellsource uses classes and rarities to organize the cards in the game.

### Classes

Cards can either be class-specific or neutral. Neutral cards are gray
and can be used in any class [deck](/wiki/Building_a_Deck "wikilink").
Class-specific cards are colored according to the class that they belong
to. For instance, Otherworlder has a neon-green color to indicate its
class. Class cards can **only** used in decks that have the same class
as the card. That means no Otherworlder cards in your Dragoon deck!
Below you can find more information about the classes in the game.

### Rarities

(Going from left to right, Free, Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)" />
In Spellsource, cards can have 5 different rarities, in the game,
indicated by a small gem below the mana cost. Below is the list of card
rarities.

- Free
- Common
- Rare
- Epic
- Legendary

Rarities often correspond to the strength of a card. Free cards are more
fundamental and simple, making them more commonly useful, but without
the strength of other cards. Legendaries often have the ability to
singlehandedly turn the tide of battle! As such, there can only be one
copy of any Legendary card, but every other rarity card can be put in a
deck twice. Be sure to use a good mixture in order to achieve a balanced
deck!

Collectible Cards
-----------------

Collectible cards are those that will appear in a player's *Collection*.
Players will be able to play the game with **every card available from
the very beginning of playing the game.** Here, we will go into more
details about the different types of cards that you can put into your
deck.

### Minion Cards

In most decks, minions will be the primary way for a player to control
the game and bring the opponent's HP to 0. Minions have a variety of
effects and stats that will be able to aid you in achieving victory.
Minions with *[Guard](/wiki/Keywords "wikilink")* can act as tanks, shielding
your champion other minions from harm, or minions with
*[Blitz](/wiki/Keywords "wikilink")* can give you the extra bit of damage you
need to finish off your opponent! If you can make sure to destroy your
opponent's minions while keeping yours alive, you can be sure to have a
path towards victory!

### Spell Cards

Spell cards are one time use cards that will do whatever effect is
printed on the card. Spells have a wide variety of effects that can
target a single minion, multiple minion, or even champions. Well-timed
spells can often swing the balance of the game immensely.
