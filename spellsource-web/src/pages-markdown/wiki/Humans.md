Humans are not native to the Lung Islands and have populated the rest of
the world where magic is much rarer. The great explorer, [Shun
He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink"), and his expedition were commissioned by the
[Lotus Empire](/wiki/Lotus_Empire "wikilink"), a state resembling Medieval
China and the Mongol Empire. They live in the [Pearl
Colony](/wiki/Pearl_Colony "wikilink").

Society
-------

The expedition arrives on a floating ship powered by
[Spellmist](/wiki/Spellmist "wikilink"), the same magic that abounds on the
islands. Numbering a thousand souls, the crew consists of families and
soldiers from the far-flung reaches of the empire including fearsome
[Horse Archers](/wiki/Horse_Archers "wikilink") and
[Alchemists](/wiki/Alchemists "wikilink"), whose principle skill is
[Awakening](/wiki/Awakening "wikilink"). But breaking the magical barrier
overloads the ships and crashes them into the island. The expedition is
forced to establish a colony called [Pearl](/wiki/Pearl_Colony "wikilink").

In the colony, Shun He's word is law but mutiny is an ever present
danger. Like the colonies in the New World, Pearl is beset with hunger,
disease, and raids from nearby [Hengeyokai](/wiki/Hengeyokai "wikilink") and
Dragovians. It is only with the help of the [Fae](/wiki/Fae "wikilink") that
the expedition begins to adapt to the Islands. The abundant magic on the
Islands supercharges the expedition's technology and the people begin to
thrive.

Relationship with Magic
-----------------------

The people of the Lotus Empire are skilled with technology powered by
the magic that abounds on the Islands. In the outside world, Spellmist
exists in a trickle, and Shun He had a theory that there must be place
that originates all magic. The main innovation is the creation of
[Dragonbreath](/wiki/Dragonbreath "wikilink"), known to humans originally as
Imperial Flame, and [Constructs](/wiki/Construct "wikilink"), magical
automata.

The Lotus Empire technology is [Silkpunk](/wiki/Silkpunk "wikilink"): machines
constructed of bamboo, silk, paper, coconut and leather. They all have
an animal inspiration for their form.

Main Human Heroes
------------------

[Shun He](/wiki/Shun_He "wikilink") (30) - Commander of the Spellsource expedition and Grand Alchemist of the Lotus Empire.

Brass (undead) - Expedition navigator. He is Shun He's Frankenstein creation. A living-Lunvane, Brass is part-human part-golem and can intrinsically sense and harness Spellsource. Back in Yunnon, he was Shun He's best friend and died in the invasion. After Shun He rose up the ranks, he returned to his home town and dug up his grave. He used his knowledge of Spellsource to reanimate his body, and now his friend is back. As a side-effect of the process, Brass is now a powerful magic user.

Himari (26) - Chief engineer of the expedition. Plucky, kawaii, and often-grease stained, she can fix just about anything.

Qach (60) - Soldier/Bodyguard/Assassin. He's an expert swordsmen and archer that loves to drink. In service to Shun He's family for his entire life, Qach treats him like a son. It's not just a feeling either. Secretly, Qach is Shun He's biological father. He knows how much Shun He looks up to his dad, so he has sworn never to tell him the truth. But he will protect his son with his life.

Ai (22) - Expedition Medic and Healer, Ai joined Shun's crew to see the world. She's secretly Emperor Wei's daughter and ran away to pursue adventure instead of live a life at court. She's also Himari's best friend.

More to come.
