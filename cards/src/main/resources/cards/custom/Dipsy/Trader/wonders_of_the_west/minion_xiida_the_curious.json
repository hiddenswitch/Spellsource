	### Another one that I'm not really sure on. Doubling Openers is simple enough, but the idea is that the entire card gets played an additional time; minions, spells and weapons. These
	### should be successive - for example, playing an odd-Cost Afermath weapon with Xii'Da out would equip it, and then equip it again, destroying the first one and activating its Aftermath.
	### The target should be the same as the first cast where possible, but for things like Discover effects I think it makes sense for the player to be able to choose for both.
	### Hopefully this thing won't be too much of a headache to get working, let me know if there are any issues with my idea.
