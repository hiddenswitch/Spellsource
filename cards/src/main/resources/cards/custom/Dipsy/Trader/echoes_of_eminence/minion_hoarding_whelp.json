  ### Honestly, I have NO clue how to manage this one. Maybe there's a way to filter card descriptions and change targetPlayers on those cards? 
  ### The intention is that any card that includes the text "both players" has its effect, or the part of the effect that benefits both players, changed to only benefit you.
  ### But cards that technically affect both players but, for example, reference "both sides of the board", "both champions" and so on should be unchanged.
