	### Not sure how to access the stored Aftermaths that you've triggered, since Goa just uses a custom spell, so I'll leave this for now.
	### Obviously, this is a weapon so can't do things like gaining Dash or Taunt, but it should in theory be able to revive itself, shuffle itself into your deck etc. Hopefully those
	### interactions are manageable. It would also be awesome if this could interact with Xue's Aftermath to turn itself into a dormant weapon, but that's probably a little too much to ask.
