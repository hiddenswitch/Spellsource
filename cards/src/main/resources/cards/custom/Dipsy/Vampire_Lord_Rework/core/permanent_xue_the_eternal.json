		### Sorry to leave you with so many cards I can't do, but I don't think we have a way to track excess healing right now, especially not relative to specific cards. 
		### Xue should track the excess healing you have AFTER he goes dormant, not any that happens or has happened before. For example, let's say you restore 5 Health to an allied (friendly) minion
		### that has 2 Health missing - Xue would gain 3 points towards revival if he's currently dormant. There are a few other cards that track your excess healing in similar ways.
