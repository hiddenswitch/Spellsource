		  ### Not sure on this one. As far as I can tell, the game currently only allows for fully converting something's Cost to a Health Cost, not adding a specific Health cost to a card. 
		  ### Also worth pointing out that the Health Cost should scale down with the card's base Cost if it costs less than 3 - so if this draws a 2-Cost spell, it costs 0 Lun and 2 Health.
