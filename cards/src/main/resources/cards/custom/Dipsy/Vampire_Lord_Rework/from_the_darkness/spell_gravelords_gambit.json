	### I honestly wouldn't even know where to start on this one. To be clear, since it says "repeat", the intention is to keep the original targets of the Aftermaths - so, for example,
	### repeating Xue the Eternal's Aftermath would summon a dormant Xue the Eternal. What happens if the Aftermath requires conditions that no longer exist, like checking a minion's stats
	### at the moment of death, it's up to you whether that just fails or uses the same values the original Aftermath had.
