  ### Not 100% sure which spell class I need to get this to work. Can the CardFilter Nine Lives uses work without adding a card to your hand? 
  ### The intention is to trigger the Aftermaths/Deathrattles of 3 random, separate friendly minions that died this game. The card shouldn't be castable until 3 friendly minions have died.
