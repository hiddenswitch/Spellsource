  ### Okay, I have no idea how to get this to work and can't find any decent examples of similar effects either. Sorry.
  ### To be clear, any effect that boosts Health should be copied fully to all friendly characters - so doubling a minion's Health will double all friendly characters' Health, and so on.
  ### The only caveat here would be +X/+X buffs only give your hero/champion the Attack for current turn, because permanent Attack is gamebreaking. 
  ### Hopefully all of that isn't too hard to implement. Let me know if any interactions aren't clear or something doesn't work.
