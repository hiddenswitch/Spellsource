It is impossible to place a minion at the leftmost position when there are 6 minions on the board, since the leftmost minion and the leftmost selection arrow are off the screen.

Clicking "Stop" when selecting a Battlecry in Sandbox Mode crashes the program.

Feature Request: There is currently no way to go back when in the Deck Creation screen without saving the current deck.

Suggestions:
Milled cards displayed somewhere
Method of conceding or ending match

Check if it is possible to remove CARD_LOCATION from SpellArg and introduce EntityReference.OPPONENT_HAND, etc (could also be used to target all cards in hand for example)
