# cluster

This module contains code for running large numbers of simulations to test artificial intelligence opponents of Spellsource, evolutionary deck creation techniques, card strength testing and other analytic/theorycraft tests.

### What belongs in this module

 - **Analysis and Data Retrieval Code**: This module must contain only analysis code. This means running and analyzing deck simulations, retrieving data from outside sources, and formatting output.

 - **Backend Clustering Code**: This module hosts the Amazon Elastic MapReduce and Spark implementations of running the simulations on a cluster.

### What does not belong in this module

 - **Unlicensed for Github:** Anything, regardless of how or if it is copyrighted, that is not licensed for redistribution in a public Git repository.

 - **Copyrighted material from other games**. This includes the titles and descriptions written on cards.
 
 - **Derivative work**: An automated or deterministic rewriting (derivation) of copyrighted content. For example, mass-substituting the Hearthstone card text by replacing and rewriting sentences in a mechanistic way is not acceptable for this module.
 
 - **Trademarks**: The use of **any** trademarked term, alive or dead, that appears in other media. For example: Even though the particular card title "Planeswalker Alchemist" doesn't appear in Magic the Gathering, Wizards of the Coast has a dead trademark for Planeswalkers.

 - **Confusing material**: Anything that may lead a reasonable person to believe that a piece of content originates from a commercial media property. This includes parodies, homages and other references. For example: Even though "Cartman Renounces Darkness" is a reasonable parody of two commercial media properties, it may lead a reasonable person to believe that Blizzard and South Park Studios worked together on a card set.
