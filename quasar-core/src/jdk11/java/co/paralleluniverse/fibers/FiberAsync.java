/**
 * A general helper class that transforms asynchronous requests to synchronous (fiber-blocking) calls.
 *
 * <h3>Usage example</h3>
 *
 * Assume that operation {@code Foo.asyncOp(FooCompletion callback)} is an asynchronous operation, where {@code Completion} is defined as:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * interface FooCompletion {
 *     void success(String result);
 *     void failure(FooException exception);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * We then define the following subclass:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class FooAsync extends FiberAsync<String, FooException> implements FooCompletion {
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void success(String result) {
 *         asyncCompleted(result);
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void failure(FooException exception) {
 *         asyncFailed(exception);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Then, to turn the operation into a fiber-blocking one, we can define:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * String op() {
 *     return new FooAsync() {
 *         protected void requestAsync() {
 *             Foo.asyncOp(this);
 *         }
 *     }.run();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <V> The value returned by the async request
 * @param <E> An exception class that could be thrown by the async request
 *
