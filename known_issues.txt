Tracking is not implemented correctly

It is impossible to place a minion at the leftmost position when there are 6 minions on the board, since the leftmost minion and the leftmost selection arrow are off the screen.

One or both of Cenarius' Treants are summoned offscreen if there are more than 4 minions on the board.

When summoned with 5 minions on the board, Cenarius should only summon the right Treant. (Tested this in HS only by placing Cenarius on the very left, this may require further testing.)

Dr. Boom should be summoned between his Boom Bots, not to the side of them.

Clicking "Stop" when selecting a Battlecry in Sandbox Mode crashes the program.

Feature Request: There is currently no way to go back when in the Deck Creation screen without saving the current deck.

Sandbox Mode:
Giving a minion Stealth in Sandbox mode makes the creature untargetable to Sandbox editting

Mechanics:
Enrage effects persist after changes to max health are made (Crazed Alchemist/Voljin)
Spiteful Smith enrage effect is not applied to new weapons that are equipped
Spiteful Smith enrage effect persists after death/removal from board

Minion summoning/morphing effects (Dragonling Mechanic, Imp Master, Polymorph, Recombobulate, etc.) place the new minion on the far right instead of in the minions old space or right of minion. Dr. Boom, Onyxia have special case summonings as well that fail
Ice Block does not stop lethal damage
Bot AI:
Priest attempts to heal self with Auchenai on board
Bot misses lethal with weapons in hand or equipped
Bot Shivs self instead of enemy/enemy minion
Suggestions:
Cards in deck counter
Secrets display when hovered over (Mad scientists?)
Milled cards displayed somewhere
Method of conceding or ending match
