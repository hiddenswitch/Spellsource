Tracking is not implemented correctly

It is impossible to place a minion at the leftmost position when there are 6 minions on the board, since the leftmost minion and the leftmost selection arrow are off the screen.

Clicking "Stop" when selecting a Battlecry in Sandbox Mode crashes the program.

Feature Request: There is currently no way to go back when in the Deck Creation screen without saving the current deck.

Ice Block does not stop lethal damage
Bot AI:
Priest attempts to heal self with Auchenai on board
Bot misses lethal with weapons in hand or equipped
Bot Shivs self instead of enemy/enemy minion
Suggestions:
Cards in deck counter
Secrets display when hovered over (Mad scientists?)
Milled cards displayed somewhere
Method of conceding or ending match

Buffed weapons do not display their stats in green

Check impact of mana cost modifiers on "Choose One" spell cards
Check impact of spellpower on "Choose One" spell cards
Check removal of UNIQUE_ENTITY, replacement is card_id
Check if it is possible to remove CARD_LOCATION from SpellArg and introduce EntityReference.OPPONENT_HAND, etc (could also be used to target all cards in hand for example)
Facelessing a Murloc Warleader does not resolve correctly
