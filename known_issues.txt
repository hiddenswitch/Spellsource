Tracking is not implemented correctly

It is impossible to place a minion at the leftmost position when there are 6 minions on the board, since the leftmost minion and the leftmost selection arrow are off the screen.

One or both of Cenarius' Treants are summoned offscreen if there are more than 4 minions on the board.

When summoned with 5 minions on the board, Cenarius should only summon the right Treant. (Tested this in HS only by placing Cenarius on the very left, this may require further testing.)

Dr. Boom should be summoned between his Boom Bots, not to the side of them.

Pint-Sized Summoner's effect disappears if you cast a spell before playing your first minion.

Choosing "Kill..." in Sandbox Mode doesn't appear to do anything. The selected minion is still on the board.

Clicking "Stop" when selecting a Battlecry in Sandbox Mode crashes the program.

Feature Request: There is currently no way to go back when in the Deck Creation screen without saving the current deck.
