The `cards` and `game` project, as derivatives of `metastone`, are licensed GPLv2. The `net` project, as an original work, is licensed as "Affero GPLv3".

This means that if you run your own local server, you must share the source to the server, even if you never distribute the server.

Affero通用公眾特許條款是改自GNU通用公眾特許條款，並加入額外條款，其目的是為了Copyleft條款應用於在網絡上運行的應用程式（如Web应用），從而避免有人以應用服務提供商方式逃避GNU通用公眾特許條款。
